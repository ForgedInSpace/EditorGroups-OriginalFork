=== Type of groups
- from Favorites tool window
- by file name without extension anywhere in the project
- by folder
- manually defined in any file

== Definitions
- in *.egroups - with language support
- anywhere else (can be disabled in settings)
                        
=== Title customization
- @group.title yourTitle
- @group.color yellow (a name from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)  
- @group.color yellow+3 (or yellow+++ or yellow-3 or yellow--- for darker or brighter shade)
- @group.color #FF0096
- @group.color 0xFF0096

=== Relative paths to the current file
- @group.related file.txt
- @group.related ../file.txt

=== Absolute paths
- @group.related C:/file.txt
- @group.related /file.txt

=== Macros
- @group.related MODULE/src/file.txt
- @group.related PROJECT/myModule/src/file.txt

=== Wildcards
- @group.related ./*
- @group.related *.txt
- @group.related file.*
- @group.related f??e.txt
- @group.related fileName (with all extensions, unless the file exists)

=== Exact filename anywhere in the project
- @group.related */foo/file.txt

=== All files with the same name anywhere in the project
- @group.related \*/foo/file.*

=== Other
- @group.disable (disables indexing of the current file)
- @group.id - must be unique across the project, creates a new group if there is more than one (otherwise path+index is used, which breaks references on refactoring)
- @group.root - root directory, by default the current file's one
                  
== Shortcuts 
- [Ctrl + Mouse Wheel] or [Ctrl + ; or ' ]  - switch file (closing the previous one)           
- [Ctrl + Alt + Mouse Wheel] or [Ctrl + Alt + ; or ' ] - switch file (leaving the previous one opened)
- [Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Mouse Wheel] or [Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ; or ' ] - switch file into a new window
- Alt + Shift + Q - refresh                                                           
              
=== Tab click modifiers
- [Ctrl/Alt + click] - open a file in a new tab
- [Shift + click] - open a file in a new window

=== Advanced actions and settings
